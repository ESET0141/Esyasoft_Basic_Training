## K- Means Clustering
K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to group data points into K distinct clusters based on their similarity

### Steps
1. Initialization: Choose the number of clusters, K, and randomly initialize K centroids.
2. Assignment Step: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid, forming clusters.
3. Update Step: Recalculate the centroids by taking the mean of all data points in each cluster.
4. Repeat: Iterate the assignment and update steps until the centroids stabilize or a stopping criterion is met 

## Feature Scaling
beacuase we all the feature have different ranges therefore we need to normalize it to be able to view it in the same scale
