## Unsupervised Learning
Finding data without labels

use case :
1. Feature engg
2. Labeling is expensive
3. EDA
4. discovering unknown patterns

workflow

unlabeled data -> data pre processing 
-> model selection -> pattern recognition -> 

### Clustering 
Grouping in a perticular way

k-means Clustering :
    Centroid based algorithm

    |   .....
    |   :::::..
    |
    |....    ..:::::.     
    |''''     '''''
    |________________

here 3 centroid can be defined so k = 3;

K means Workflow
1. Assigning Data points
2. Finding euclidian dist
3. finding Min. dist

Main challenge : How to Find K 
methods for sovling this
1. The Elbow Method
2. Silhoutte method
